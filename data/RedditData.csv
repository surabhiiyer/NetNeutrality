"Wed, 20 May 2015 00:09:00 -0700",I need help understanding the good points of Net Neutraliy,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Recently, someone sent me this in a discussion we were having on Net Neutrality. From what I know about net neutrality, alot of this doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. But I don&#39;t know enough to understand what is wrong with it. Can someone help?</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;I understand that internet providers aren&#39;t doing anything that&#39;s &quot;not neutral.&quot; Which is my fucking point. And I&#39;m aware that the FCC went out of their lane and reclassified the internet(though no net neutrality bill has been passed which limits what they can do. No point to it though, not more than one instance where the big bad companies were doing something mean to you, and yet lot&#39;s of potential downfalls.</p> <p>So no proven downside WHATSOEVER to not having the law/reclassification. Hypothetical bullshit. Makes me wonder why people want the law then....</p> <p>Ajit Pai(a dissenting FCC commissioner) said it best, &quot;net neutrality is a solution that won&#39;t work to a problem that simply doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;</p> <p>So what DOES deeming the internet regulable under Title 2 mean? It means that the internet is no longer an information service and becomes a &quot;telecommunications service&quot; that can be regulated by the FCC...like basic fucking cable.</p> <p>The utter bullshit about ISP&#39;s holding people hostage was and is complete and total fear mongering that never had any basis in fact and was simply one of Bob McChesney&#39;s many mantras that never came true. At this point he&#39;s been wrong 100% of the time about all the evil things that were going to happen if the internet wasn&#39;t regulated and yet the left still holds on to his every word.</p> <p>If an actual law passes which would accomplish far more than a regulation change, expect slower broadband, more expensive broadband, fewer options for service, and generally less innovation.</p> <p>Side note: the government does almost nothing well. Why people would want to let them enter an arena that works wonderfully and has changed everyone&#39;s life for the better...is completely beyond me. For that matter, I&#39;m not convinced the FCC should exist at all. There are no longer 3 networks. There are hundreds. Thousands and thousands of internet &quot;networks&quot; and millions of opportunities for entertainment and news. Satellite radio. It goes on and on...no point to it at all except perhaps to regulate VHF frequencies and UHF frequencies that shouldn&#39;t be clogged with trash.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/Catlover18""> Catlover18 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/36lhtk/i_need_help_understanding_the_good_points_of_net/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/36lhtk/i_need_help_understanding_the_good_points_of_net/"">[3 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/36lhtk/i_need_help_understanding_the_good_points_of_net/

"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 18:32:25 -0700","This is a letter I wrote to my congressman. If you haven't already, I urge you to contact your representatives and let them know your position.","<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><pre><code> Dear Representative Turner, </code></pre> <p>I Write to you today to urge you to oppose H.R. 1212 or the &quot;Internet Freedom Act&quot; introduced last month by Rep. Marsha Blackburn. Rep. Blackburn aims to prevent the Federal Communications Commission from enforcing their new Internet Neutrality rules passed on February 26. She claims that The FCC enforcing these rules would allow the Obama administration and Federal Government to &quot;take over the internet&quot;. I believe Rep. Blackburn and the bill&#39;s supporters to be uninformed on the topic. Internet Neutrality is simply the idea that all data traveling over the internet should be treated equally. Rep. Blackburn&#39;s house.gov states the following; &quot;Once the federal government establishes a foothold into managing how Internet service providers run their networks they will essentially be deciding which content goes first, second, third, or not at all. My legislation will put the brakes on this FCC overreach and protect our innovators from these job-killing regulations&quot;. This is exactly the opposite of what Internet Neutrality is as the very nature of it is to prevent the Federal Government or Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s) from prioritizing one byte of data over another.</p> <p>Many large ISP&#39;s offer cable/satellite TV as well as on demand video. Thus, it is in their interests to slow down, or &quot;throttle&quot;, competing services such as Netflix, YouTube and Hulu. These anti-competitive practices hurt the consumer and in the end and only serve to expand the wallets of the corporate leaders. If ISP&#39;s want me to use their services, they should innovate and earn my loyalty with high quality products, rather than by squashing out the competition. If the FCC&#39;s new rules go into effect, ISP&#39;s would be forced to step up their game and improve their services to compete with others. It is a basic principle of economics that competition leads to innovation and benefits the consumer. </p> <p>Last year, major ISP&#39;s and the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) made over $1,000,000 in political contributions, including $46,000 to Rep. Blackburn; $37,500 to Greg Walden, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology; $50,000 to Mark Pryor, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, among numerous other representatives and senators. These contributions are made in an attempt to prevent the passing of legislation that would jeopardize their firm control over the interconnected cables that make up the Internet and their ability to limit their competition.</p> <p>The Internet is one of the most valuable components to modern life and I implore you to prevent it from being destroyed by telecom giants and allow the FCC to do its job of regulating these companies.</p> <pre><code> Sincerely, /u/weymaro </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/weymaro""> weymaro </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/336pof/this_is_a_letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_if_you/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/336pof/this_is_a_letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_if_you/"">[1 comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/336pof/this_is_a_letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_if_you/

"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 07:00:53 -0700",Protecting Net Neutrality,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>&quot;Net neutrality&quot; also called net equality is the principle that Internet service providers(ISP&#39;s) and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application etc. The term &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003 as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier.</p> <p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) recently sought public comments on net neutrality. This was spurred by Airtel’s move to charge for VoIP calls. This means the company offers customers internet access as a product and allocates a certain amount of data for the money paid. What you choose to do with that data should be your concern. But Airtel now says, “You cannot use the data you paid for to use this particular service”, and would have you pay Rs 100 for the data and additional money to use a service using that very data. A simple analogy: The electricity company sells you 100 units for Rs 900, and says you could use that energy to power TVs, ACs, etc. But should you use the units sold to charge your inverter, you would need to pay extra. The comparison of electricity with the internet is relevant because both are utilities. The carrier gets revenue by charging customers for talk-time. Additionally, it sells 2G and 3G services. Carriers have been primarily geared towards selling talk-time. Selling internet services was secondary. They have been slow to react to the potential of third-party internet services. Consumers are replacing traditional texting with WhatsApp or Viber and traditional network calling with apps such as Skype. There is a very real danger that, in five years, carriers may earn no money from texting and calling.</p> <p>When Flipkart extended their support to Airtel Zero platform, net neutrality supporters in India started to vent their anger on the e-commerce giant by downrating its Android and iOS apps. Supporters gave 1-star rating to Flipkart and mostly mentioned ‘Net Neutrality matters’ in their reviews over the past few days. A majority of the new reviews of Flipkart’s app on Google Play are related to net neutrality. While the overall rating of Flipkart’s app has not been affected much, the total number of 1-star ratings has shot up.</p> <p>Due to intense lobbying by telecom operators like Airtel and Vodafone, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is planning to allow them to block apps and websites to extort more money from consumers and businesses — an extreme violation of net neutrality.</p> <p>TRAI has released a consultation paper with 20 questions spread across 118 complicated pages and wants us to send them an e-mail by 24th of April, 2015.</p> <p>It is our responsibility to remind TRAI(Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) that their job is to protect the rights of consumers, not the profit margins of telcos.</p> <p>The full article can be seen on <a href=""http://www.pulokeshroy.in/2015/04/net-neutrality-india.html"">http://www.pulokeshroy.in/2015/04/net-neutrality-india.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/vppulokesh""> vppulokesh </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/32x98u/protecting_net_neutrality/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/32x98u/protecting_net_neutrality/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/32x98u/protecting_net_neutrality/

It essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the Internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the Internet, which is why federal courts have already slapped down the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) twice before when attempts were made to impose net neutrality mandates in the past.</p> <p>As you may know, the FCC recently voted in <strong>secret</strong> to adopt net neutrality mandates and reclassify broadband Internet access services as &quot;telecommunication services&quot; under Title II of the Communications Act. <strong><em>This would allow the government to regulate the Internet under the same rules designed for &quot;Ma Bell&quot; in 1934, which hampered innovation and growth for more than fifty years.</em></strong></p> <p>I support a governing framework for the Internet that allows more competition, more innovation, and more freedom of speech. I believe that <em>less government regulation</em>, not more, provides for the best opportunity for the Internet to continue to be a major source of innovation and economic growth for the United States and the rest of the world. When the issue comes before the Senate, I will carefully consider everything you have said in making a decision on what is best for North Carolina and the rest of the country.</p> <p>Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. It is important to hear from citizens themselves on issues that affect the state and the nation. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other important issues</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Thom Tillis</p> <p>U.S. Senator</p> </blockquote> <ol> <li>They didn&#39;t meet in secret</li> <li>The Government is not regulating the internet; it&#39;s preventing ISPs from ruining the internet.</li> <li>Reddit was watching the whole thing and the FCC did what reddit, Democrats and Republicans alike were <em>wanting</em>.</li> <li>Tillis is likely paid by Telcos to put out this agit-propaganda disinformation campaign about tollboothing the internet.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/infinity_QE""> infinity_QE </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y8oh1/thom_tillis_r_junior_senator_in_nc_gave_this_anti/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y8oh1/thom_tillis_r_junior_senator_in_nc_gave_this_anti/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y8oh1/thom_tillis_r_junior_senator_in_nc_gave_this_anti/
"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 19:46:55 -0800","Let's start our campaign to stop the ""Freedom"" of the Internet bills now!","<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>As a lot of you have already seen and read all over the web, we have some corporation funded representatives already looking to fight the FCC decision as soon as they can. I say we need to take action now. If we start our campaign now then it will hopefully head them off before anything can be done. If we make our voices so loud that they can&#39;t drown them out then we will win this war. The FCC decision was just one battle, and we have to be prepared to fight for the entire war over the internet. </p> <p>What I am calling for is that we send out a weekly email to our representatives demanding they fight the new bills that will be coming to the floor in the future. We need to make sure they understand where we, the citizens stand on the issue. I have typed up a rough draft of an email that can be sent, but I welcome any help to make this as formal and direct as possible. If anyone wants to duplicate this on another site I welcome it. The faster we can get this circulating the better. </p> <blockquote> <p>Dear Senators and Representatives:<br/> There is no doubt that the public wants real Net Neutrality. Recently the Federal Communications Commission reclassified the internet to help fix a problem with paid prioritization before it became a major issue. We as voters, tax payers, and US citizens write you today letting you know that we want Title II classification of the internet and its services. We want the internet to remain an open, equal system where no one is the gatekeeper. In a time that major internet service providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast, Verizon, etc. are pressuring you to fight this decision, we ask you to stand with those who elected you. Stand with the people you agreed to represent when you took office, and fight any bill that will take this power away from the FCC.<br/> In short: Let the FCC do its job. By reclassifying Internet-access service under Title II of the Communications Act, the FCC can protect Internet users from online discrimination and blocking. Any other approach will fall short.<br/> Don&#39;t put the public in the slow lane. Protect real Net Neutrality now.<br/> Thank you, </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks for reading.

"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 15:29:34 -0800",Will Reddit please proofread my letter to my congressman on net neutrality?,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Dear Rep. Duncan,</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard a lot about you, having lived my entire life in Knoxville. I&#39;ve heard that you&#39;re an honest and upright man, and I hope that you&#39;ll listen to my message with an open mind. </p> <p>The State of Tennessee is unique in that while we are a largely rural state, we have made great strides in technology. We are a global capitol of additive manufacturing (3D printing) research. We are also, of course, the home of ORNL. The University of Tennessee, Tennessee Tech, and Vanderbilt are constantly producing scholars who are contributing to a more technologically advanced state and a more advanced nation. The city of Chattanooga has made leaps and bounds into the future by converting to a fiber optic network, giving even users with Chattanooga&#39;s “slow” internet package speeds above the national average.</p> <p>The internet is potentially the most powerful tool of the modern era. Though it is not a perfect tool, the internet has brought academic knowledge to the fingertips of millions, helped build a sense of a global community, and helped keep physically distant friends and families close through email, video calls, and message boards. One of the greatest advantages of the internet is that it is so widely available to both those wishing to browse websites and those wishing to have their own websites.</p> <p>To get down to business, the internet is threatened by a monopolistic scenario. The few main Internet Service Providers have overwhelming power over the net due to the high start-up fee and complex logistics of becoming an ISP. In addition, the lobbying power of large ISPs has allowed them to essentially buy the rights to prevent anyone else from becoming a provider in many areas. Basically, to avoid competition, they buy the whole market. Now these same companies are seeking even more power by trying to take the authority to purposefully “clog” internet connections. With this power, they could essentially censor the internet to hurt small businesses, activists, or politicians who they view as a threat. The “Internet Super Highway” ISPs are wanting to enforce is really just a regular road that throws poor or unwanted travelers in a ditch on the side.</p> <p>As a supporter of the “Internet Freedom Act,” you presumably are familiar with the FCC’s February 26, 2015 ruling to apply Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 to the Internet. The fact that the Grand Old Party wants to overturn this ruling came as a shock to me. As the party who announces itself as the protector of Constitutional freedoms, I was certain that the Republicans would be enthusiastically supportive of this ruling which would help promote the freedom of speech and help defend the Internet market from monopolistic conditions.</p> <p>Representative Duncan, please change your stance on the “Internet Freedom Act.” The title of the act alone is a mockery reminiscent of Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm.’ IFA implies the message “All internet users are free, but some are more free than others.” Protect the REAL freedom of speech. Protect individuals&#39; and small businesses&#39; voices. Protect the Republican party and the State of Tennessee by preventing their names from being tarnished by this act. Please don’t let us down, and change your stance on this act.</p> <p>Thank you for your time, God bless America, and Go Vols, [my name]</p> <p>Edit: Careless errors.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/triforced130""> triforced130 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y6sl8/will_reddit_please_proofread_my_letter_to_my/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y6sl8/will_reddit_please_proofread_my_letter_to_my/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2y6sl8/will_reddit_please_proofread_my_letter_to_my/

"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 09:01:45 -0800",What are interLATA fees and where to learn more? Any other advice/info is appreciated.,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have been going back and forth with one of my friends about the decision. He is a lot more technically sound than I am and has been in the space a lot longer. He sent this to me:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;NetFlix launches their OTT service. Consumers love it and flock to it (as I did, and Hulu and ESP etc etc). Here was the unintended consequence. Each SP pays interLATA fees as defined in FCC CFRs. In the case of Netflix they were transporting via Level 3. So, what right? Here is what occurred. YouTube and Netflix traffic spiked over the inter LATA, each SP has to pay reciprocal interLATA transport fees which are built into the cost of your and my monthly fee. No problem. Except that the interLATA fees spiked 200-300% to the SP&#39;s. The business model quickly broke. Now, your and my $99 a month fee no longer created a positive cash flow for the SP&#39;s in fact many including BHN, TWC and VZ were losing money. So, Comcast (the criminals who produce MSNBC) starting throttling data and got caught. Shame on them and I am glad they were caught. But, the interLATA fee problem still existed. Then, caching to the rescue. Both Google and Netflix went to all the SP&#39;s and presented a deal we will provide you with caching servers on prem at your location, free of charge...except a year later after these caching systems were in everyone’s data centers the NTFLX and GOOG sales team handed the SP&#39;s a renewal bill. I have no personal interest in the internet being a utility. That is my personal feeling. Some may feel differently. I do not believe the federal government is either efficient or cutting edge and I question the motives behind this.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>So basically what he is saying is that the decision is not right because of the increasing cost to providers? Is there additional info that is available that I can read up on about the fees? Any advice on how to learn more (or respond to his points) about this is welcome. I am happy about the decision, but I feel like I don&#39;t have all the facts now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/iwillnotlurk""> iwillnotlurk </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xd960/what_are_interlata_fees_and_where_to_learn_more/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xd960/what_are_interlata_fees_and_where_to_learn_more/"">[1 comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xd960/what_are_interlata_fees_and_where_to_learn_more/

Glover, Verizon SVP Public Policy and Government Affairs) claim that the FCC&#39;s decision </p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators and investors&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>On the contrary, the FCC&#39;s decision makes the future of the Internet more certain. It prevents Verizon from shaping the content we see based on who pays the most. It protects a variety of political speech and entertainment media, shielding consumers from moneyed interests who would stifle their lesser-funded adversaries and lobby to us inside our own homes.</p> <p>It preserves the equal playing field that has enabled small companies to compete with big ones. Equality Verizon has worked to destroy. As Vint Cerf, co-creator of the TCP/IP protocol that underpins the entire Internet, said:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The remarkable social impact and economic success of the Internet is in many ways directly attributable to the architectural characteristics that were part of its design. The Internet was designed with no gatekeepers over new content or services.</strong> The Internet is based on a layered, end-to-end model that allows people at each level of the network to innovate free of any central control. By placing intelligence at the edges rather than control in the middle of the network, the Internet has created a platform for innovation. This has led to an explosion of offerings – from VOIP to 802.11x wi-fi to blogging – that might never have evolved had central control of the network been required by design. <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/vint-cerf-speaks-out-on-net-neutrality.html"">(source)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Verizon says,</p> <blockquote> <p>What has been and will remain constant before, during and after the existence of any regulations is Verizon’s commitment to an open Internet that provides consumers with competitive broadband choices and Internet access when, where, and how they want.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a disconnect between what Verizon wants and what consumers want. Verizon fails to acknowledge that, of the record-breaking 4 million public comments to the FCC, <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/net-neutrality-comments-to-f-c-c-overwhelmingly-one-sided-study-says/"">an estimated fewer than 1% took their side</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, there&#39;s a disconnect between what Verizon <em>says</em> and what they do. </p> <ul> <li><a href=""http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/04/25/this-hilarious-graph-of-netflix-speeds-shows-the-importance-of-net-neutrality/"">This hilarious graph of Netflix speeds shows the importance of net neutrality</a></li> <li><a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth"">Verizon caught throttling Netflix traffic even after its pays for more bandwidth</a></li> </ul> <p>Verizon&#39;s media contact, Ed McFadden, included his phone number: 202-515-2441.

Times;<br/> &quot;I wanna try again on some amount of specificity to when the order might be public. Of course, until it&#39;s public, it <em>is</em> a secret plan, just in terms of dictionary definition. How long would it typically take for an order of this length to be made public?&quot;</p> <p>A: Jon Sallet, FCC General Council;<br/> &quot;It&#39;s not a secret plan, Jim. It&#39;s a part of a process.<br/> The process began with a public notice of proposed rulemaking,<br/> a <em>lengthy</em> process of obtaining public comment,<br/> the <em>normal</em> process of deliberation,<br/> now we&#39;re going to go into the normal process by which commissioners issue, for example dissents, and the commission, for example, responds to those dissents. </p> <p>And I want to explain that last piece...</p> <p>For example, a recent DC Circuit opinion said that it was an obligation of a regulatory commission to engage in the arguments that were presented to it <em>including</em> the statements of any dissenting commissioners. </p> <p>So we will work, as I said, as quickly as possible. It&#39;s not possible to give an average here or at least it&#39;s not possible for <em>me</em> to give an average. But our goal is to get the process moving forward so that the whole order can be released, with of course all commissioner statements, it can be sent to the Federal Register, published in the Federal Register and then these rules will become effective 60 days after that publication.&quot;</p> <p>Follow up Q:<br/> &quot;Do the lengths of the dissent, does that factor in here? The longer the dissent does [*] that more than you need to respond to?&quot;</p> <p>A:<br/> &quot;It&#39;s not a question of the length of the dissents. It&#39;s a question of this... and let me read from the DC Circuit opinion to which I earlier referred,</p> <p>This is the DC Circuit saying, and I&#39;m eliminating internal quotemarks and citations, &#39;It most emphatically remains the duty of <em>this</em> court to ensure that an agency engage the arguments raised before it, including the arguments of the agency&#39;s dissenting commissioners.&#39;</p> <p>We will do that as quickly as we can.&quot;</p> <p>[*] I think there was a me/him/or CSPAN glitch :)</p> <hr/> <p>It should be noted that the commissioners also voted for &quot;Editorial Privilege&quot;. Which means that they can go back over the Order and clean up any typos, footnotes, references, attributions, etc. Basically spit-and-polishing the, up until now, <em>draft</em> document.</p> <p>That may or may not add time to it&#39;s release. *<em>shrug</em>*</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/nspectre""> nspectre </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xc7fm/my_answer_to_when_is_the_fcc_order_going_to_be/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xc7fm/my_answer_to_when_is_the_fcc_order_going_to_be/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xc7fm/my_answer_to_when_is_the_fcc_order_going_to_be/

By 1907, AT&amp;T&#39;s competitors had captured 51 percent of the telephone market and prices were being driven sharply down by the competition. Moreover, there was no evidence of economies of scale, and entry barriers were obviously almost nonexistent, contrary to the standard account of the theory of natural monopoly as applied to the telephone industry.[56]</p> <p>The eventual creation of the telephone monopoly was the result of a conspiracy between AT&amp;T and politicians who wanted to offer &quot;universal telephone service&quot; as a pork-barrel entitlement to their constituents. Politicians began denouncing competition as &quot;duplicative,&quot; &quot;destructive,&quot; and &quot;wasteful,&quot; and various economists were paid to attend congressional hearings in which they somberly declared telephony a natural monopoly. &quot;There is nothing to be gained by competition in the local telephone business,&quot; one congressional hearing concluded.[57]</p> </blockquote> <p>How does it feel to dig your own grave?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/FlamingCheese4""> FlamingCheese4 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xb9el/how_does_it_feel_to_be_useful_idiots_reddit/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xb9el/how_does_it_feel_to_be_useful_idiots_reddit/"">[2 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2xb9el/how_does_it_feel_to_be_useful_idiots_reddit/

It gives free acsess to anything on the internet without discrimination If it was taken away by the FCC then cable companies can charge you an additional fee on top of your regular fee for using websites you use regularly for slower service on that website. This means cable companies can monopolize the internet. (I.G. If you have comcast you have to pay the monthly bill. Then on top of that you need to pay and additional 10 bucks just to use Reddit each month. If you use many more regularly the cost will add up quickly.)

I appreciate you taking the time to write. It is an honor to serve you in Congress and I hope you will continue to write with your thoughts and ideas on moving our country forward. </p> <p>On February 4, 2015, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler announced proposed rules that would regulate the Internet under Title II of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which is commonly referred to as &quot;net neutrality.&quot; In simple terms, net neutrality requires high-speed Internet providers to treat all Internet traffic equally and prohibits these providers from slowing or blocking web traffic when they deem it necessary. </p> <p>By considering reclassification of Internet broadband services under Title II, the FCC would be setting us back as a nation of innovators. Title II was designed for regulating the legacy telephone network in the United States back when only one telephone company existed. It was never intended, nor designed, to regulate the Internet, which is why Congress has rejected this classification in the past.</p> <p>By developing these rules, the FCC is inserting itself into an area that has traditionally been characterized by vibrancy, innovation, and strong entrepreneurial development. Federal regulation of the Internet will have serious negative consequences for the future of innovation and investment when it comes to broadband in America. This overreach has the potential to harm not only the companies that provide broadband, but also the consumers and businesses which will be forced to pay for serious changes in the marketplace that may result from increased regulation.</p> <p>I assure you that I am following this issue closely and will continue to encourage the FCC to change its course on this very important issue. Again, thank you for contacting me, and do not hesitate to do so again when an issue is important to you. </p> <p>Sincerely, &quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/handtohandwombat""> handtohandwombat </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2wxjss/cos_cory_gardner_sent_me_a_form_letter_reply/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2wxjss/cos_cory_gardner_sent_me_a_form_letter_reply/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2wxjss/cos_cory_gardner_sent_me_a_form_letter_reply/

I don't think it does.,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I work for Intel. </p> <p>I&#39;m not in a position of authority. I work in the Fab. This is NOT my area of expertise, although I care about the issue and try to be informed. </p> <p>I was pretty bummed to find that Intel was on an letter with other companies against Title II regulation. </p> <p>I also ran into a little piece on the company intranet about Net Neutrality, and emailed the author. It turns out he is, I believe, Intel&#39;s main lobbyist in Washington D.C.</p> <p>He told me that Intel was FOR Net Neutrality. It seems everyone thinks that we&#39;re against it. </p> <p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/12/7203089/at-t-net-neutrality-fiber"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/12/7203089/at-t-net-neutrality-fiber</a></p> <p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/09/companies-that-sell-network-equipment-to-isps-dont-want-net-neutrality/"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/09/companies-that-sell-network-equipment-to-isps-dont-want-net-neutrality/</a></p> <p>After speaking to him via phone and email, I got pretty discouraged. It really feels to me as if Intel is trying to say &quot;Yay! We&#39;re for NN!&quot; while doing everything it can to sink real regulation and oversight. </p> <p>After talking to the guy for a while, It seems Intel believes that Title II regulation will slow growth. In addition, Intel thinks that the FCC has all the authority it needs under section 706, so the FCC shouldn&#39;t TRY for Title II regulation. </p> <p>I think that&#39;s hogwash, to be polite. I hope it&#39;s the position of this one guy, and not the company? I doubt this though.</p> <p>Frankly, I think that Intel will do well in a competitive environment. Without Net Neutrality, we WILL have a less competitive environment. I&#39;m afraid of broadband companies strangling the next Google or Netflix because they don&#39;t want the competition for their own services. As a stockholder, I think this is a bad move. </p> <p>I also don&#39;t think the Broadband companies will spend less under Title II. Oh, they SAY they will, but of course they do... What else would they say?</p> <p>Frankly, I think broadband companies are simply afraid of unbundling. Back in the dial up days when most of us got our internet over the phone lines, there was Title II regulation and the ISPs had to lease their lines to competitors at sane prices. This gave us choice and competition. You could go get a mom and pop local company to be your ISP, and their service was AWESOME. I think the entire resistance to Title II is that the ISPs don&#39;t want those days again. Comcast has long been one of the worst companies in America in terms of customer service and satisfaction.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know why Intel is following their lead. We should want MORE competition, not less. Why are we doing this? </p> <p>I looked into section 706, and it seems to lack a LOT of teeth. Our main lobbyist said that the FCC could use section 706, but Title II would be tied up in the courts for a long time. </p> <p>I read up on court cases from 2014, and the circuit court in D.C. said that the FCC gave up it&#39;s authority and that all it needed to do was reclassify to title II and it could have it back. The courts themselves seem to disagree with Intel&#39;s position. Section 706 is a mandate to report and vague permission to do something if broadband coverage isn&#39;t widely spread enough. It&#39;s very vague, and WILL be tied up in the courts.</p> <p>From the court case...</p> <p>“Even though section 706 grants the Commission authority to promote broadband deployment by regulating how broadband providers treat edge providers, the Commission may not … utilize that power in a manner that contravenes any specific prohibition contained in the Communications Act. ... We think it obvious that the Commission would violate the Communications Act were it to regulate broadband providers as common carriers. Given the Commission’s still-binding decision to classify broadband providers not as providers of “telecommunications services” but instead as providers of “information services,” such treatment would run afoul of section 153(51).”</p> <p><a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0115/DOC-325150A1.pdf"">http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0115/DOC-325150A1.pdf</a></p> <p>I think it&#39;s pretty disingenious for Intel to say that we&#39;re for Net Neutrality while we try to sink it. I think Intel is lying to people, and I don&#39;t like it, as a customer, as an employee, and as a shareholder. </p> <p>The FCC is voting to decide if we get Title II regulation BACK (We had it before and it was awesome) on the 26th of Feb, 2015. It&#39;s coming soon! I wish my company was on the right side here, but it seems they&#39;re not. </p> <p>I wish I could change that, but it seems I can&#39;t. </p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas? Should I be calling for boycott? Should I take to Twitter? Will that help? </p> <p>I am also a little scared of being too effective. I LIKE my job, and Intel is good to me as an employee.

Thom Tillis regarding Net Neutrality, below is his response. I feel that his response is initially hopeful but rapidly diminishes. My personal thoughts are that we do in fact need government interference to stop the big players from taking double dipping and actually provide a competitive service. I am in support of Title II regulation, but it seems as if he may be opposed. Any thoughts on this?</p> <blockquote> <p>Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding net neutrality. I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.</p> <p>Net neutrality is the principle that every Internet Service Provider (ISP) will be required to treat all data traveling over their networks equally. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) attempted to put rules in place to enforce net neutrality on two separate occasions, but they were struck down by the federal appeals court both times.</p> <p>As you may know, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler announced a proposal to adopt net neutrality rules and reclassify broadband Internet access services as telecommunication services under Title II of the Communications Act. The FCC Commission is expected to vote on the 332 page proposal at the end of the month.</p> <p>I support a governing framework for the Internet that allows more competition, more privacy, and more freedom of speech. I believe that less government regulation, not more, provides for the best opportunity for the Internet to continue to be a major source of innovation and economic growth for the United States and the rest of the world. When the issue comes before the Senate, I will carefully consider everything you have said in making a decision on what is best for North Carolina and the rest of the country.</p> <p>Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. It is important to hear from citizens themselves on issues that affect the state and the nation. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other important issues. </p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Thom Tillis U.S. Senator</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/alienwrkshop51""> alienwrkshop51 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2we5ev/thoughts_on_sen_thom_tillis_net_neutrality_stance/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2we5ev/thoughts_on_sen_thom_tillis_net_neutrality_stance/"">[2 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2we5ev/thoughts_on_sen_thom_tillis_net_neutrality_stance/

I called you several weeks ago For some internet and cable.</p> <p>Quicker than molasses On a brisk December day, You sent your guy, Armando, To, eventually, come my way.</p> <p>Heroically, he strode on in, Strapped on his carpet booties. And off he marched, attending To his internetly duties.</p> <p>But sadly, he revealed, my dreams would not unfold as planned. “Your cable’s all chopped up, you see, It’s right here in my hand!”</p> <p>“We’ll send another guy right away. And in two weeks or more, Between the hours of noon and eight He’ll run cable to your door!”</p> <p>And so the days crawled on. All my musings went un-tweeted. My posts went on un-posted. My cell phone data, near depleted.</p> <p>At last, the day arrives! I rise with hopefulness and glee. For at some unknown time today, I’ll have internet and TV!</p> <p>Shoved aside are all my meager plans, My appointments and my tasks. My life reduced to waiting For that mystery hour to pass.</p> <p>The hours drip and dribble by, My fingers crossed for luck. My eyeballs bug, and twitch, and scan, For some dude in a Comcast truck.</p> <p>The final hour strikes… then ends! My diced up cable lay unfixed! Dried up are all my humble dreams Of watching YouTube and Netflix!</p> <p>Enraged, I call, complain, and whine, As manly as I’m able. But no pleas, demands, nor whimpering Would avail me any cable.</p> <p>I didn’t understand the service agent’s explanation. Her foreign accent, while exotic, Only brought on more frustration.</p> <p>Something about the cable line Was too close to a bog, Or the installer’s shovel was all digital And all my dirt was analog.</p> <p>Whatever was the cause, I sat in impotent defeat. Doomed to spend forever Bereft of “likes” or “tweets”.</p> <p>Perhaps I’d wander through the wild, Wrap my feet in beaver pelts, Unable to Google poison ivy, I’d live with painful bottom welts.</p> <p>But then, a notion dawned on me That sent my spirits soaring! Maybe Comcast treated me this way To keep my life from being boring!</p> <p>Maybe all their flops and failures Were of a grand design To take away predictability And free up all my time!</p> <p>Such incompetence brings whimsy! Must our lives be so concrete? Perhaps they’ll string up proper cables? Or perhaps piñatas filled with meat!</p> <p>So let us not dwell endlessly On how much Comcast sucks… Their neglect and lazy service, And their non-arriving trucks.</p> <p>Their apathy’s intentional, So don’t get mad or nervous. Just go on and grab those ankles, It’s all part of that Comcast service!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/brandon425""> brandon425 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vwuf7/an_ode_to_comcast/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vwuf7/an_ode_to_comcast/"">[1 comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vwuf7/an_ode_to_comcast/

Now the FCC suddenly wants to regulate it based on their definition of &#39;neutrality&#39;.</p></li> <li><p>Government and lobbyists go hand in hand which leads to corruption. </p></li> <li><p>I still have a landline telephone, I pay the phone company for access to that line and on top of that I pay fees and taxes, the largest one being to the FCC as a universal fee.

The Free Press, the Internet Innovation Alliance &amp; a host of other pro-net neutrality groups have praised WHeeler&#39;s decision to unveil his proposal(02/05) for later voting on 02/26,with one FCC commissioner probably abstaining(republican). It is now etched in stone,Broadband Providers(those that provide internet services,heretofore described as &#39;telecommunication&#39; services) can not, REPEAT, not &#39;cherry pick&#39; website traffic speeds(vis a vis netflix,spotify,etc),block,slow, or speedup for an additional consideration( tribute paid under the table).All humans on earth should praise this proposal.PERIOD. Although lone dissenters on the FCC board decries this will lead to more taxes,more litigation, less innovation(translation: Verizon,A.T&amp; T. capital investment dollars fleeing overseas to less stringent European Title II regulations?)....more on that one later. By acting as &#39;mob enforcer&#39; ,wheeler has got Obama&#39;s back, the total &amp; complete &#39;RECLASSIFICATION&#39; of broadband Internet as a telecommunication service, a privilege granted at the pleasure of FCC. After &#39;reading&#39; nearly 4 million views on the subject,it seems to back up net neutrality groups that decry the arbitrary slowing down of data traffic. Wheeler&#39;s plan gives blanket control to review prices Broadband providers charge customers(netflix?), &amp; backbone companies that connect to back end of broadband network &amp; who remain invisible to the ordinary public. This scrutiny goes double for wireless providers(telco companies,previously exempted from net-neutrality rules). This will not affect the pay-TV content ecosystem(pay tv providers,DISH,DirectTV,COmcast). Now, theoretically, companies providing video streaming will not have to pay tribute to the minions of the lobbying group,National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assoc.

He also believes that government regulation will silence free speech despite the fact that the entire point of Net Neutrality laws is to stop telecom companies doing exactly that. Furthermore, he sent the email through Townhall.com - a right wing news organization that I unsubscribed from a month ago. I find it grossly inappropriate to use what should be an independent news website&#39;s mailing list to send out lies pushing your own political agenda.<br/> The full text of the email is written below and I urge all of you to pick apart its fallacies and email the senator here: <a href=""http://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact"">http://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact</a> </p> <p>TL;DR Senator Mike Lee is spreading ignorant lies about Net Neutrality and I want to help reverse that. Let him know how wrong he is, and just how many people are aware of his ignorance. </p> <p>&quot;Dear Friends,</p> <p>Obamacare, the VA scandal, the IRS scandal--these are just a few examples of what happens when we give government huge power without oversight. </p> <p>It&#39;s about to happen again--the Obama Administration is fighting for a government takeover of the Internet and the Federal Communications Commission is going to vote on it February 26th. That&#39;s why I am writing you today--I need your help to stop this.</p> <p>President Obama came out a few weeks ago urging the FCC to vote to regulate the Internet the same way that it regulates public utilities under Title II. What this means is that, for the first time, billions of dollars in fees will be attached to Internet service just like they are to telephone service. </p> <p>You see, under Title II if someone wants to own a telephone company, there are fees baked into the law--fees companies pass on to customers. </p> <p>Now, under this new regulatory regime, Internet service providers will be subject to these fees as well, and then pass them on to you, the consumer. </p> <p>This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class, being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on. </p> <p>The Internet is built on speed and dynamism, it’s always changing, there are always new and better ideas that are exploding onto the scene, and part of the reason for that is that innovators are not having to go ask Washington, DC for permission every time they want to do something new. </p> <p>What this really comes down to is a fundamental question:</p> <p>Who do you want in charge of the direction of the Internet: people at dot-com startups that brought us game changing companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon and Uber; or nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats in our nation’s capital?</p> <p>There is another aspect of this that gets overlooked: the Internet is an incredibly important force for freedom, for liberty, and the rights of free speech that we hold dear. It is an existential threat to tyrants in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia who seek to keep information from their people. </p> <p>We must preserve the high ground for the United States to stand up to these countries and tell them to keep the Internet free and preserve free speech on the Internet throughout the world. We cannot do that if we are regulating the Internet in a similar manner ourselves. </p> <p>I am not accusing anyone of sinister motives here, but I am deeply concerned about the idea of any government bureaucrat having the power to tell companies what they can and cannot do. In the long term, this could have a chilling effect on political speech, in ways that today we could not even begin to imagine. </p> <p>We do not have much time left to stop this gigantic government takeover of the Internet. The FCC is voting on February 26th and the Left is mobilizing to support their effort to do so. We cannot let the conversation be totally one-sided. The FCC needs to hear from us today--not tomorrow or next week or next month. Today.</p> <p>Please join me and go sign the petition to keep the Internet free. We must stand for liberty and preserve the Internet free of government interference. </p> <p>Thank you for standing for Internet freedom. </p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Senator Mike Lee Republican-Utah&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/productofmycreation""> productofmycreation </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vh3h7/utah_senator_mike_lee_tried_to_convince_me_to/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vh3h7/utah_senator_mike_lee_tried_to_convince_me_to/"">[4 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vh3h7/utah_senator_mike_lee_tried_to_convince_me_to/

"Mon, 09 Feb 2015 16:30:08 -0800",I received a response on data usage from the FCC!,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Thought I would share this. I received a response from the FCC in regards to data usage caps. They have pointed me to something I think everyone should be aware of and fill out if you have concerns about it. Feel free to x-post this into other relevant subs, or whatever it is you have to do!</p> <hr/> <p>Thank you for filing a complaint with the FCC regarding data caps applied to your broadband Internet service. The FCC recognizes the potential significance of data caps and other usage-based pricing for consumers of both fixed and mobile broadband services, and has been evaluating developments on this issue in several ongoing proceedings. In particular, the FCC asked for comment on a variety of usage-based pricing and transparency issues in conjunction with its proceeding to promote and protect an Open Internet.</p> <p>You might want to add public comments to this proceeding’s record. If so, you can search for this proceeding (Docket No. 14-28) and submit your comments through this portal: <a href=""http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs"">http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs</a>.</p> <hr/> <p><strong><em>the comment I left on the docket is as follows. IF anyone needs help filling it out, please let me know. Its a bit clunky, but not too difficult.</em></strong></p> <hr/> <p>There has been evidence of decent improvement in an Open internet in recent weeks, and I would love to see this progress more.</p> <p>A subject that has not been touched on (at least significantly) is usage caps. The reality is this: the internet grows, high def content is on the rise. Youtube, netflix, hulu, and live streaming services such as twitch.tv are a huge deal.</p> <p>Work from home has never been more popular as well. usage caps limit all these things to great effect and stifle the progress of an open internet. With recent news, it is my fear that large ISP&#39;s will try to take advantage of this by having stricter mandates on their current usage caps. I fear if they cannot have a lane-based internet, they will try to punish those that use more data. I do not think ISP&#39;s being classified as utility will scare them from this due to competition, ESPECIALLY if most ISP&#39;s agree behind closed doors to all do this.</p> <p>As of right now, this is hurting me. I don&#39;t want it to get worse. I exceed my usage cap and pay an absurd fee for it. the only two options I have let me either:</p> <p>A.) increase my monthly usage cap (I can buy x gb for x USD)</p> <p>B.) Get business class internet.</p> <p>In option A, it works but only to a certain point. I have reached that point. There is a treshhold where option A is no cheaper than just paying the overages without going with this option to begin with.</p> <p>Option B is EXTREMELY expensive. We are talking $300+ dollars per month for the package i have now (which is about 90$ minus the cap overages). What I am paying in overages doesn&#39;t even begin to come close to entertaining option B as a viable option.</p> <p>ISP&#39;s claim data usage is there because their network capacity simply cannot handle the load. However, to sell the usage cap idea, they usually claim in the same paragraphs that only a very very small precentage of their consumer base ever reach those data usage caps and go on to show a chart on what precentage of their average cap usages for each package is.</p> <p>This, to me, does not make sense. I think to most people that take the time to look at things such as &quot;internet allowence&quot; policies they will quickly realize its a money grab, and not a very well thought out one.</p> <p>There has been plenty news of several ISP&#39;s reaching 70, 80, and even 90% net profit. They have the money to support and expand their infrastructure if needed, and there has been plenty evidence ISP&#39;s haven&#39;t even begin to reach capcity of their current infrastructure.</p> <p>In summary, data usage caps I believe will be used by ISP&#39;s as a backup plan to &quot;fast lane internet&quot;. it is also a current thing that is being used now that hurts many users in being able to either work from home, or entertainment. We are not being charged per gigabyte overage of high-def cable tv content, and should not be charged like this for internet-focused content. It is absurd, greedy, and stifles economic growth.</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> <hr/> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/distortednet""> distortednet </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vd1m9/i_received_a_response_on_data_usage_from_the_fcc/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vd1m9/i_received_a_response_on_data_usage_from_the_fcc/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2vd1m9/i_received_a_response_on_data_usage_from_the_fcc/

Now imagine Comcast comes along and makes 64 billion a year by charging for cups which nobody else is able to provide because Comcast bought them all.</p> <p>Can Comcast and other service providers legally do that? Unfortunately they can because there are no rules to say they can&#39;t. Although it may not be illegal at present time, it is highly unethical. This is exactly what the FCC&#39;s Net Neutrality proposal would help prevent and will be voted on at the end of this month.</p> <p>The internet is free, IT IS NOT FOR RESALE! Groups like Comcast have no right to charge excessive fees for, or limit access to, something which is already free to use and is a publicly shared resource. Reasonable service charges is one thing, monopolizing an entire market just to drive up prices and limiting access is totally a different story and shouldn&#39;t be permitted at all.</p> <p>This is what Net Neutrality is all about.</p> <h1>TeamInternet</h1> <h1>NetNeutrality</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/RF2OOO""> RF2OOO </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2v16aw/this_is_how_to_explain_what_net_neutrality_is_all/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2v16aw/this_is_how_to_explain_what_net_neutrality_is_all/"">[5 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2v16aw/this_is_how_to_explain_what_net_neutrality_is_all/

Maybe protesters show up at his residence hit a bit too close to home. For whatever reason, Wheeler seems to have had his come-to-hither moment; a man of the people, a champion of democracy (we&#39;ll see soon enough).</p> <p>Assuming Title II becomes a reality ... we, those who support real net neutrality, need to think about the long game. What happens after Title II? A couple thoughts:</p> <p>(1) The telecom industry will pour an obscene amount of money into the 2016 presidential election in an effort to elect whatever candidate vows to kill net neutrality. If a Republican wins, Wheeler and net neutrality will probably be gone, and we&#39;ll be fighting a whole new battle.</p> <p>(2) Verizon will sue, but on what grounds? Title II provides solid legal footing, so we&#39;re looking at a lawsuit on constitutional grounds, perhaps the same argument Verizon argued in its lawsuit against the FCC: the First Amendment protects ISPs against compelled speech, but this legal argument seems weak as under net neutrality ISPs are not associated with the data they carry; they carry all the data equally.</p> <p>Anyway, Title II is a start, but it might be the beginning rather than the end.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.</p> <p>As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was formed to regulate interstate and international communication &gt;by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in the United States. Recently, the FCC announced that they are seeking comments on a &gt;proposed rule attempting to constrain the internet and allow companies to pay more for faster internet.</p> <p>The Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) would seek to reclassify internet broadband service as an old-fashioned &quot;Title II&quot; &gt;common carrier services. As such, the FCC would be able to regulate the internet as they would and telecommunications services &gt;rather than an information service, as it is right now. The fact of the matter remains that the Internet has thrived for years because the government has not exercised strong regulatory control over it. Broadband providers have been able to innovate and invest in new &gt;networks and services, improving the customer experience. Imposing new burdensome regulation on these providers, there is less &gt;ability and less incentive to innovate, ultimately harming consumers. The free market and existing competition laws protect consumers &gt;better than the unnecessary rules made by the FCC.</p> <p>Currently, the only way for broadband providers to recoup their costs of building and maintaining these very expensive networks is to &gt;charge consumers. These net neutrality rules will prevent the broadband consumers from being able to spread the cost around by also &gt;charging &quot;edge providers.&quot; These certain providers are using and benefiting and often profiting from the broadband networks. Again, &gt;this will harm consumers.</p> <p>You may be interested to know that the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which I am a member of, has already began holding &gt;hearings on this proposed rule. Furthermore, Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio) introduced H.R. 4752 which would limit the FCC &gt;authority to regulate broadband under Title II of the Communications Act. Finally, The FCC is soliciting comments throughout this &gt;rulemaking process. To communicate your thoughts with the FCC, please send an email to <a href=""mailto:openinternet@fcc.gov"">openinternet@fcc.gov</a>.</p> <p>Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. I appreciate the opportunity to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. &gt;Please feel free to visit my website (<a href=""http://www.house.gov/burgess"">www.house.gov/burgess</a>) or contact me with any future concerns. &quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>I can&#39;t really understand what his position is here, nor how he&#39;s sourcing his comments on how things would be better or worse.

"Mon, 08 Dec 2014 10:16:08 -0800",My plea to the FCC complaint box for broadband,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>&quot;I live in a very rural area and have been living here for going on 3 years now. I have been trying to get some sort of broadband reliable internet for all of this time but I have had no luck. I am going on my second semester of college right now and will be starting online classes over my traditional classes so I absolutely need reliable internet. I once had hughesnet satellite service which was a complete waste of money because I never once hit the advertised speeds and it was constantly down, I could barely even open a web page. Now I have the satellite service Excede which only gives 20Gb a month at the most which is 120 dollars, I also hardly get past 1 mb/s(the minimum for high speed internet by FCC standards is in fact 4mb/s so this is not high speed internet as they are advertising as well). This will not cut it at all because I will have to watch full online classes, some are over an hour , and an hour of high quality video is 2.4 GB. So what that means is that after around 4 hours I am over my data cap, this is absolutely absurd. I have been looking at your site and have seen the Universal Service initiative and have also seen how President Obama is pushing for broadband internet to be a necessity for students, if this is a necessity then I should definitely have it. I have called Verizon and Comcast (which are supposed to be in my area from what the broadbandmap says, I find this to be false advertising) but they didn&#39;t know what I was talking about in anyway, . Verizon told me that they were 3000 feet from my house although my neighbor who lives right across the street has Verizon DSL so either they are lying or there data is old. I am absolutely fed up with the internet in my area and I need it if I am going to be successful in college. I hope you all get back to me quickly to help me with this situation.&quot;</p> <p>This was my plea with the FCC complaint box to maybe come and help with this situation I have also sent things to my State Rep, my mayor, the mayors whole council, and the governor. I am truly fed up with this situation my next door neighbor has verizon DSL and that would be all I would need but still they refuse to do any sort of engineer check at my location.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/brandon425""> brandon425 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2oo11y/my_plea_to_the_fcc_complaint_box_for_broadband/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2oo11y/my_plea_to_the_fcc_complaint_box_for_broadband/"">[4 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2oo11y/my_plea_to_the_fcc_complaint_box_for_broadband/

So let&#39;s go all Nazi on companies that don&#39;t for the sake of profit. Companies make sure their interest gets heard and so should we.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the letter printed in the current issue of The Economist that sparked this train of thought:</p> <p>Don&#39;t be neutral SIR – As a pro-business publication, I believe that The Economist should be championing the removal of net neutrality (“Not neutral about net neutrality”, November 15th). “Neutrality” does not work in any comparable industry, so why is the internet an exception? Take postal services. If a business wants a parcel delivered by the standard service, Royal Mail will happily deliver it over a couple of days.

It is a digital stream with priority coming directly from my ISP. Comcast could in theory reallocate this bandwidth to be used for general internet if they so desired. Sooo the way you view neutral internet, does that mean that TV would be illegal because Comcast is allocating and prioritizing some of their digital bandwidth to TV? Full disclosure: I disagree with net neutrality on principal. Most people do not understand the complexity of internet routing, and I definitely don’t trust Congress to enact regulations which improve the situation. Every law on the books will eventually be used by a corporation (ATT, Comcast) to prevent further competition. I believe a much better solution is to promote competition through municipal broadband and regulations/incentive which make market entry more favorable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/barackoghanja""> barackoghanja </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2o1urr/does_net_neutrality_view_cable_tv_as_illegal/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2o1urr/does_net_neutrality_view_cable_tv_as_illegal/"">[4 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2o1urr/does_net_neutrality_view_cable_tv_as_illegal/

And no, I will not be taking any screen shots.</p> <p>I answer inbound customer service calls for Verizon Wireless. I actually don&#39;t mind my job: most people are entertaining to talk to, contrary to popular belief not all VZW policies are evil, it&#39;s outsourced so I don&#39;t have corporate shills on my back all day, and the pay is pretty well above minimum. Anyway, I have access to a customer&#39;s usage records: date and time of calls and texts, numbers connected to (no I don&#39;t see content of texts), and data usage. I can see IP addresses, but I don&#39;t have web access at my station, and I can&#39;t legally share that information with a caller unless they specifically ask about a certain address (which had never happened and never will).</p> <p>Anyway, here&#39;s why I&#39;m posting: when I pull up the data usage screen there is, and had been for a few months, a section labeled &quot;Sponsored Data Usage&quot;. Of course, being that VZW doesn&#39;t offer any sponsored data currently, this section is empty. But if I&#39;ve learned anything about VZW it&#39;s that my their executives are incredibly intelligent and can play this market like a fiddle. So this is pure speculation, but I&#39;m convinced that Verizon Wireless is waiting for the FCC to settle upon a net neutrality policy that is conducive to sponsored data on wireless plans, and will then pull out all available guns. I think it&#39;s clear if the biggest carrier pushed for sponsored data right now that that could tip the regulators against allowing sponsored data. Also, if you&#39;re wondering what would get sponsored first, I&#39;m betting on NFL games.</p> <p>Anyway, like I said this is anecdotal and speculation. Also, I&#39;m sure, given the political leanings of reddit that most people will believe me and jump on a Verizon hate bandwagon. To be clear, I&#39;m not pushing for hating any company, just pointing out what will certainly happen if strong regulations aren&#39;t created.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/becauseiliketoupvote""> becauseiliketoupvote </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nm0r1/verizon_wireless_plans/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nm0r1/verizon_wireless_plans/"">[3 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nm0r1/verizon_wireless_plans/

Audio CDs are dead as doorknobs. DVD movies and TV, software DVD-ROMs, and paper books are steadily diminishing in favor of Netflix, iTunes, Steam, and ebooks.</p> <p>Standing between the entire content industry and the entire body of consumers is the internet. Internet access in other countries is steadily reaching higher throughput and accessibility, and at diminishing costs - by contrast, <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/257404/why-is-american-internet-so-slow"">U.S. internet access currently ranks 42nd in the world, behind Slovenia and Belarus</a>.</p> <p>Regardless of how your politics or philosophy square with network neutrality, it is indisputable that eliminating it will further constrain an already-constrained resource. There is simply no plausible scenario where eliminating network neutrality will generally improve internet accessibility or affordability.</p> <p>And while customers will certainly be hurt, the content industry will suffer at least as much. Eliminating network neutrality transforms ISPs from simple intermediaries to gatekeeping trolls - they will be the portal to content consumers, and they intend to extract as much money as they can from the content industry for doing what they&#39;re already supposed to do. Worse, the laws of economics will reduce consumer demand thanks to higher customer prices (tiered packages, etc.)</p> <p>Given those constraints, the push to eliminate network neutrality is the #1 enemy to the near-future business of the content industry. It&#39;s a much more direct and endemic threat than anything the content industry has ever faced.</p> <p>And that begs the question: Where is the content industry in all of this?!</p> <p>I would have expected a massive coalition of every major source of content, of every major kind - TV, movies, music, software, books - to be out in force and in droves, pushing for the protection of network neutrality as the central pipeline between the entire copyright industry and its consumer base. And yet... it is largely silent, which is simply baffling to me.</p> <p>Is there any explanation of how ending network neutrality is possibly good, or even not-totally-hostile, for the content industry?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/sfsdfd""> sfsdfd </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nccyn/why_is_the_entire_content_industry_not_adamantly/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nccyn/why_is_the_entire_content_industry_not_adamantly/"">[comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2nccyn/why_is_the_entire_content_industry_not_adamantly/

"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 19:55:01 -0800",Who do the likes of Comcast feel threathened by Net Neutrality?,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I live in a country where the government blocks a whole bunch of sites so I have to use non-trivial methods to get to the info I want. In that spirit, I certainly do applaud Obama--it seems now that the Republicans have retaken much of the hill he seems to be growing a pair again. </p> <p>However, looking at the issue from the POW of the likes of Comcast or Time Warner, I&#39;m asking myself so? What&#39;s the big deal? I already have the market on its knees and can continue to screw the consumers over as long as I have been doing so far. There will be equal rules for everyone so yeah okay, but I have a trillion dollar and 10 years headstart on them. </p> <p>And here&#39;s where it gets confusing for me: why should they feel really so threathened? I have one explanation but it&#39;s so ugly I don&#39;t want to really think of things in such a pessimistic way. That explanation is, Comcast etc are really awful citizens, their interests are NOT the same as the interests of the public. They want to keep on feeding off their sweet oligopolistic position, and dare make it in not uncertain terms. In other words, they&#39;re not AFRAID of you as a public. That view is certainly strongly supported by the various bits and pieces I&#39;ve been reading on e.g. Comcast lately.</p> <p>And that makes me wonder: if I&#39;m right and that really is the case, then you as a public really do NOT need those companies around, like at all. Let them die, switch to another ISP, do whatever is possible to NOT give them your money. I know it is not as simple as I want it to sound like, but man, if they are what I think they are, they are horrible on many levels, and do NOT deserve to live on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/apeaquatic""> apeaquatic </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n8b73/who_do_the_likes_of_comcast_feel_threathened_by/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n8b73/who_do_the_likes_of_comcast_feel_threathened_by/"">[1 comment]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n8b73/who_do_the_likes_of_comcast_feel_threathened_by/
"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 16:40:00 -0800",Net Neutrality email that just went out,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><h2>This is my email which just went out to business owners, lawmakers, and influencers throughout the country. If you&#39;d like a copy with the links intact, please message me. Other than that-- I&#39;d like to know what you think, Reddit!</h2> <p>Dear friends, media, business owners, politicos, and government officials,</p> <p>I am about to tell you everything you want to know about what I believe to be quite literally one of most important issues of the decade: Net Neutrality. If this email is too long, simply skip to the bottom for the summary.</p> <p>As you probably know, I&#39;ve been involved with software development and computer networking my entire life, I am the owner of a small software company, and also very involved with politics on all levels, advocating for smaller government. With these three things in mind, I&#39;d like to talk to you about one of the most important issues up for debate that we&#39;ve had for decades: Net Neutrality.</p> <p>First, let me make clear that Net Neutrality is not a &quot;new&quot; thing. It&#39;s been around in practice, law, or both since the beginning of the Internet. In January, the court of appeals struck it down.</p> <p>So what is it, anyway? In a nutshell, Net Neutrality ensures that when you ask your browser to visit a website, it simply works. Want to go to CNN.com? Done. eBay? No problem! How about Netflix? Violà-- choose a movie!</p> <p>The reason this works so well is that there is no content filtering: All data traffic is treated equally. This is the essence of Net Neutrality.</p> <p>Since the repeal in January of this year, the first shots have been fired in a war that has the power to fundamentally change the way the Internet functions in our nation-- forever. Specifically, Comcast-- who provides both Internet and cable TV-- began throttling the connections for Netflix-- who provides Internet-based TV. Comcast demanded payment of millions and millions of dollars in exchange for turning the pipes back on. Netflix initially refused, but quickly came to realize that this was no bluff, and succumbed to the demands of Comcast, paying millions so that their customers could finally access their service again. </p> <p>Again: this was merely the first shot fired, and more is going to come (AT&amp;T basically said that they were not going to honor Net Neutrality anymore, either). This type of control over our content doesn&#39;t go just one way: What if BigCable decides to simply not allow Netflix or other streaming services, because it competes with their core business? What if eBay secures a deal to be the only shopping website for a provider? The ISPs can simply shut down these services and deny access to Internet users. As mentioned earlier, these are not merely &quot;what ifs&quot;-- these happenings have already begun.</p> <p>The kneejerk response from free-market advocates (like myself) would be to simply let the free market take care of it. There&#39;s only one problem: There is no free market when it comes to ISPs. High speed Internet is a monopoly in 80% of markets, and an overtly non-competitive duopoly in the rest. The barrier to entry to be a player? Four hundred billion dollars (doubling from $200 billion in 2007). If you were to combine the entire liquidated net worth of Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Bill Gross, and Oprah-- you&#39;d be less than a third of the way there-- and that&#39;s if the government wasn&#39;t already implementing practices that dictate no competition emerges for these players. Simply put: Free market methodology cannot be applied to monopolies, because no competition will be generated.</p> <p>I hope I have established two things: 1) We need Net Neutrality 2) ISPs are a monopoly</p> <p>Now, let&#39;s move on to the solutions</p> <p>The arguments currently being offered at the federal level are all centered in a false dichotomy: That we can either reclassify the Internet as a Title II service, or that we cannot have Net Neutrality at all. Both of these are equally dangerous. Here are the differences between Title I and Title II-- something that is key to know in this argument: - The FCC classification of &quot;Title I&quot; is essentially a laissez faire classification. This is how the Internet is currently categorized. It is not taxed, and is largely left unregulated by the FCC. In simple terms, they have said &quot;We don&#39;t understand this emerging technology, so we aren&#39;t going to mess with it&quot;. - The FCC classification of &quot;Title II&quot; is what governs things like radio or televisions-- they are well-known mediums whose fundamental technology doesn&#39;t often change. They are subject to &quot;decency standards&quot; and also a whopping 16.1% tax. The last thing we need online is the FCC dictating what kind of speech we can have-- or a 16.1% tax.</p> <p>There are two ways to restore Net Neutrality without destroying the Internet in the process: 1) Allow the FCC to appeal the January decision to the Supreme Court (and win). This maintains its status as a Title I service. 2) Through an act of Congress, mandate that the Internet remain a Title I service and also apply Net Neutrality rules to it.</p> <p>In summary: 1) The Internet needs to restore the Net Neutrality rules that were repealed in January. 2) ISPs are monopolies and cannot be subjected to free market rules (because the absence of competition does not make a free market). 3) Title II reclassification of the Internet is just as bad as not restoring Net Neutrality. We need Net Neutrality under a Title I classification. 4) The solution is to either appeal January’s decision or to create an act of Congress restoring Net Neutrality.</p> <p>I believe that the Internet is one of the most important things that humankind has ever created. It has allowed the free exchange of ideas, the streamlining of business, and revolutions in efficiency that we could never have imagined previously. It is one section of the US economy that has continued to grow in spite of the Great Recession-- year after year. </p> <p>We must be extremely careful with what we do and how we treat this great mechanism. The decisions we make today will have an enormous impact in 20 years. To have the best possible opportunity for competition internationally, our children need and deserve the Internet with Net Neutrality rules intact.</p> <p>Please help work with me to spread the word about the necessity of restoring Net Neutrality, but never, ever by reclassifying the internet as a Title II service-- both issues are of equal importance.</p> <p>I am open for any questions you may have, simply hit Reply, or give me a call at [removed]</p> <p>Mike Glenn, CEO, Devion Software Developers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/mg92661""> mg92661 </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n7rf8/net_neutrality_email_that_just_went_out/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n7rf8/net_neutrality_email_that_just_went_out/"">[2 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2n7rf8/net_neutrality_email_that_just_went_out/

That&#39;s just digging ourselves deeper into the hole.</p> <p>and this is the rest of our conversation until now:</p> <p>ME: V are you implying that the Net Neutrality proposition is cronyism?</p> <p>V: Yes, as is the proposition to regulate internet service as a utility.</p> <p>ME: Do you have an alternative idea for stopping the telecom giants from extorting more customers and companies?</p> <p>V: Yes. Free up the market to allow more competition. When you have a regulatory regime with which only big corporations can afford to comply, what do you end up with? It&#39;s like every other over-regulated market in which the players become fewer and bigger.</p> <p>ME: You do realize what you are talking about is what the telecom companies have already done and why the FCC is putting forward the Net Neutrality proposal right? The telecom giants already dominate the market by working together, and the net neutrality proposal is an idea to fix that by reclassifying them as common carriers among other issues.</p> <p>ME: Net Neutrality is a proposal to maintain the internet as a level playing field for all users, the telecom giants want to restrict users access who do not pay a premium.</p> <p>V: They&#39;ve already done what? Freed the market? Surely you jest. Regulating them as utilities will only grant them greater monopoly privileges.</p> <p>ME: They already have a monopoly. How will regulating them as utilities grant them greater monopoly privileges?</p> <p>ME: No they have already created their own regulatory regime, Time-Warner, Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and COX are the regime</p> <p>V: Can you name a utility that isn&#39;t a monopoly? Exactly, and the last thing they want is a free market.</p> <p>ME: How exactly do you suggest we free up the market then? Google is shaking up the market with Fiber but infrastructure is a slow, expensive process other than that there is nothing going on.</p> <p>V: You do it the same way one would do it with any other market. De-regulate, or at least make the regulatory regime results-oriented rather than process-oriented.</p> <p>ME: What regulations are keeping competition down right now?</p> <p>V: It&#39;s not just one, or a handful, it&#39;s the cumulative effect of all of them. The regulatory capture in the market is enormous.</p> <p>ME: I was under the impression that it is the manipulation of the market by the cooperation of the telecom giants that is stifling competition. If you can enlighten me to some other possibility I am all ears.</p> <p>ME: Lack of ISP competition is at the heart of the market failure not any regulations.</p> <p>V: Take politics out of markets.</p> <p>ME: What politics?</p> <p>V: SMH</p> <p>ME: V I am an open-minded individual prepared to listen to everything you have to say, you are claiming that what I believe is incorrect and I am asking you to explain the not so obvious to me so that I can be further educated, I am not trolling you.</p> <p>V: Who are the winners in most markets today? Are they the businesses who offer the best products and services at the best prices, or are they the businesses with the most political influence?</p> <p>ME: Well to the best of my knowledge the top companies in the world are Shell, Chevron, and Exxon-Mobil so I have to believe the top of the top is there because of market demand. I can&#39;t think of any political reasons why they would be more profitable than their competitions</p> <p>INSERT THIRD PARTY ACCUSING ME OF TROLLING</p> <p>ME: The internet is a very serious matter to me, it is an unlimited wealth of information and prospect by far the greatest creation of mankind, and I say that with every conviction I can muster.</p> <p>V: Valhallaswyrdo, have you ever heard of the term &#39;corporate welfare&#39;? If not, Google it and do some reading. The petroleum industry is the biggest recipient. Also, do some reading about &#39;regulatory capture&#39;.</p> <p>ME: I have heard it but I&#39;ll be honest I have no knowledge on the subject so I will do that. Can you give me insight as to how that will apply to the Net Neutrality proposal?</p> <p>End of conversation as of right now.</p> <p>I feel like I am in over my head here I&#39;ve done a bit of research into corporate welfare and regulatory capture but I fail to see how this applies to the Net Neutrality Proposal can someone either explain to me where my argument is incorrect or direct me to more information to tie the loose ends together possibly?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/valhallaswyrdo""> valhallaswyrdo </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m5s9h/discussing_net_neutrality_with_my_friend_need_help/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m5s9h/discussing_net_neutrality_with_my_friend_need_help/"">[4 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m5s9h/discussing_net_neutrality_with_my_friend_need_help/

"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 08:56:44 -0800",How I explain Net Neutrality to people who don't know what it means,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Imagine looking through a store catalog and finding something you want to purchase (or a website if the person is somewhat tech savvy). You find a product and want it shipped to you overnight. You pay the postal fee for overnight shipping.</p> <p>The shipping company arrives at the store and loads your order onto their truck. Then they tell the store, &quot;If you want us to deliver this to your customer overnight, you are going to have to pay us. People order too much stuff from you.&quot;</p> <p>If the store does not pay the shipping company their extra fee, the shipping company will take their time and you will receive your purchase three to five days later.</p> <p>You paid the shipping company for overnight delivery. This is just like you pay your ISP for a certain &quot;speed&quot; of data delivery. However, because the store you order from ships out a lot of products (&quot;data&quot;), the shipping company feels it should also demand a payment from the store. If the store refuses, it will not deliver the data overnight, despite you having already paid them for overnight delivery.</p> <p>Net Neutrality means that the shipping company will not be allowed to purposefully delay your deliveries because the company you purchased the product from doesn&#39;t also pay an additional fee.</p> <p>Why is this is bad for business? Your small company cannot afford to pay this extra fee because it will cut more deeply into their already small profit margin. They will have to raise the prices of their products in order to remain profitable. The big companies can afford the loss and will be able to charge less, thus creating an unfair advantage by essentially &quot;partnering&quot; with the shipping companies and further shutting out competition.</p> <p>Why is this bad for you? You will be paying for fast shipping, but you will only get it if you ship from a &quot;preferred&quot; store. So the shipping company will charge you full price for shipping every time, but will purposefully not meet that obligation some of the time. Also, the price of products you want may increase because some companies will have to charge you more to make up for the extra money the shipping company is charging them...to deliver something you have already paid the shipping company to deliver.</p> <p>In the world of physical products, if you pay for overnight shipping, you have the expectation of overnight shipping. Without Net Neutrality, in the world of data, if you pay for 20 mbps, you cannot count on your ISP delivering the data you want at that speed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/StoodieDain""> StoodieDain </a> <br/> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m34ra/how_i_explain_net_neutrality_to_people_who_dont/"">[link]</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m34ra/how_i_explain_net_neutrality_to_people_who_dont/"">[6 comments]</a>",http://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/2m34ra/how_i_explain_net_neutrality_to_people_who_dont/
